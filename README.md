This is the script that collects real-time data (run this first for a few minutes)

### blockchainDataAnalyzer.py
This is the script that analyzes the collected data (make sure that blockchain.py has run long enough for some data to be analyzed)

Note that both the script are written in python 2. To run it just use the python2 blockchain.py or python2 blockchainDataAnalyzer.py command in a terminal from the src directory.
